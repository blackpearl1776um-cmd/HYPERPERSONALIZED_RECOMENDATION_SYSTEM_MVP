# HYPERPERSONALIZED_RECOMENDATION_SYSTEM_MVP

# 🌱 Sustainable Shopping Assistant

## 🚀 Hyper-Personalization Recommendation System

A sophisticated AI-powered recommendation engine that learns individual sustainability preferences through behavioral analysis, delivering truly personalized product recommendations that evolve with user interactions.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

### **Core Innovation**
Traditional systems: "Users like you also bought X"  
**Our system:** "Based on YOUR behavior, YOU care 2.3x more about vegan than carbon-neutral"

### **Key Achievement**
Built a complete **hyper-personalization MVP** from scratch that demonstrates:
- Real-time preference learning from user behavior
- Dynamic score adjustments (0.3x to 2.0x weight range)
- Professional Streamlit interface with interactive demos
- Production-ready architecture
